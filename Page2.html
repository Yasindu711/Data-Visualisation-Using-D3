            <h2>Overview of Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                The scatterplot aims to represent the relationship between healthcare spending and the average life expectancy across the various OECD countries. Each data point (circle) on the graph represents a country along the x and y axes.
                The x axis measures the proportion of a country's GDP spent on healthcare expenditures, reflecting the financial investment a country makes in its healthcare systems including all the different types of financing schemes, healthcare functions, and health providers. The y axis represents the average life expectancy of individuals in a country regardless of age or cause of death.

            <p>
                Each country has been assigned a colour corresponding to their respective continent.
